This project involves analysing a pizza sales database consisting of four tables: `pizzas` (pizza_id, pizza_type_id, size, price), `pizza_types` (pizza_type_id, name, category, ingredients), `orders` (order_id, order_date, order_time), and `order_details` (order_details_id, order_id, pizza_id, quantity). The analysis addresses several business questions: retrieving the total number of orders placed, calculating total revenue from pizza sales, identifying the highest-priced pizza, and determining the most common pizza size ordered. It also includes listing the top 5 most ordered pizza types, finding the total quantity of each pizza category ordered, analysing order distribution by hour, and determining category-wise pizza distribution. Additionally, the project calculates the average number of pizzas ordered per day, identifies the top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue, and calculates each pizza type's percentage contribution to total revenue. Furthermore, it analyses cumulative revenue over time and determines the top 3 pizza types based on revenue for each category. The insights derived from this analysis are valuable for optimizing business strategies and improving sales performance.
